# coronaviruschart.live
Combating the spread of misinformation on Coronavirus/ COVID-19 by providing easily accessible, visually rich insights.

Welcome!

Aim of the project is to aggregate and visualize information (data points/ charts/ maps/ media content) on Coronavirus at the state and regional levels in India. This project is published as an open-source under the Apache License 2.0. The Progressive Web App is hosted at www.coronaviruschart.live

The primary target audience is people from non-metro cities, town and villages thereby giving the highest consideration to accessibility of information. This includes support for regional languages, minimal/ apt usage of color/ contrast, read-aloud feature, etc.

Design stack - Adobe Illustrator, Sketch, Figma, InVision

Roadmap

Stage I
- Mobile-first approach
- Two screens bifurcated as Landing page & Map view

Landing page
- Treemap (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treemapping)
- Indian state-specific hierarchical data with 'infected cases' as the deciding parameter to auto-allocate screen area to each state
- Only 6-7 states to be shown as a treemap, remaining states with datapoints will auto-scroll left to right at the bottom
- Covid-19 related news snippets as text with auto-scroll left to right, sourced from news aggregators but vetted manually

Map view
- Outline map of the entire country for easy recognition, ability to zoom in/ out and pan to the state of interest by the user
